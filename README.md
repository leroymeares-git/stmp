# STMP (subsonic terminal music player)

A terminal client for *sonic music servers. Inspired by ncmpcpp.

## Features

* browse by folder
* queue songs and albums
* volume control

## Dependencies

* libmpv-dev (build)
* [mpv](https://mpv.io)

Go build dependencies

* [tview](https://github.com/rivo/tview)
* [go-mpv](https://github.com/YouROK/go-mpv)

### MacOS path setup

#### Homebrew
On MacOS, if you installed mpv with brew you'll need to set the following paths:

```
export C_INCLUDE_PATH=/opt/homebrew/include:$C_INCLUDE_PATH
export LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/homebrew/lib:$LIBRARY_PATH
```
#### Macports
Alternatively, if you installed mpv with Macports, set these paths:
```
export C_INCLUDE_PATH=/opt/local/include:$C_INCLUDE_PATH
export LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/local/lib:$LIBRARY_PATH
```
## Compiling

stmp should compile normally with `go build`. Cgo is needed for linking the
libmpv header.

## Configuration

stmp looks for a config file called `stmp.toml` in either `$HOME/.config/stmp`
or the directory in which the executable is placed.

### Example configuration

```toml
[auth]
username = 'admin'
password = 'password'
plaintext = true  # Use 'legacy' unsalted password auth. (default: false)

[server]
host = 'https://your-subsonic-host.tld'
scrobble = true   # Use Subsonic scrobbling for last.fm/ListenBrainz (default: false)
```

* d/delete - remove currently selected song from the queue
* D - remove all songs from queue
